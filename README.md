This code is used for value prediction of a time series.
I have given a raw data of a price or value (e.g., an object price) changes during time. Th etime scale could be evveryday, evvery wee, or evevn a year.
I have applied LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) network in order to predict the next 18 months value.
